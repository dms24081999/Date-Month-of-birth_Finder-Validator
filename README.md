# Date-Month-of-birth_Finder-Validator
This Code Works Better in Code::Blocks(http://www.codeblocks.org) IDE.
This Code has been developed, by the trick given by my Favourite Maths Sir Mr. Mario Vaz in STD.11th. 
This Code determines your date and month of Birth by taking 5 inputs of (1.Yes or 2.No) in Date section, and 4 inputs of (1.Yes or 2.No) in Month section, it also determines whether your date/month of Birth is valid or not (Eg.30th Feb doesn't exist, if the code gets this output, then it gives the statement "Date/Month of Birth is Not Valid")
